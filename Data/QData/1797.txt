1655. Distribute Repeating Integers
You are given an array of n integers, nums, where there are at most 50 unique values in the array. You are also given an array of m customer order quantities, quantity, where quantity[i] is the amount of integers the ith customer ordered. Determine if it is possible to distribute nums such that:
The ith customer gets exactly quantity[i] integers,
The integers the ith customer gets are all equal, and
Every customer is satisfied.
Return true if it is possible to distribute nums according to the above conditions.
