352. Data Stream as Disjoint Intervals
Given a data stream input of non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, summarize the numbers seen so far as a list of disjoint intervals.
Implement the SummaryRanges class:
SummaryRanges() Initializes the object with an empty stream.
void addNum(int value) Adds the integer value to the stream.
int[][] getIntervals() Returns a summary of the integers in the stream currently as a list of disjoint intervals [starti, endi]. The answer should be sorted by starti.
