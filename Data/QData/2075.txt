757. Set Intersection Size At Least Two
You are given a 2D integer array intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi] represents all the integers from starti to endi inclusively.
A containing set is an array nums where each interval from intervals has at least two integers in nums.
For example, if intervals = [[1,3], [3,7], [8,9]], then [1,2,4,7,8,9] and [2,3,4,8,9] are containing sets.
Return the minimum possible size of a containing set.
