2514. Count Anagrams
You are given a string s containing one or more words. Every consecutive pair of words is separated by a single space ' '.
A string t is an anagram of string s if the ith word of t is a permutation of the ith word of s.
For example, "acb dfe" is an anagram of "abc def", but "def cab" and "adc bef" are not.
Return the number of distinct anagrams of s. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
