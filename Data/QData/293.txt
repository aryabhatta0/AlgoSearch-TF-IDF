1585. Check If String Is Transformable With Substring Sort Operations
Given two strings s and t, transform string s into string t using the following operation any number of times:
Choose a non-empty substring in s and sort it in place so the characters are in ascending order.
For example, applying the operation on the underlined substring in "14234" results in "12344".
Return true if it is possible to transform s into t. Otherwise, return false.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
